## Starting the project
Use 'yarn install' and 'yarn start' to run the project.

## Navigating the app
By default, you will end up on the dashboard with all of the bookshelves. From here, you can move books to different shelves,
or remove them altogether by moving them to 'None'.
If you add /search to the url, you will end up on the search page. Simply type in any of the terms in SEARCH_TERMS.md to
see a list of results. You can move any of these books to any of the bookshelves.
